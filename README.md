# First Draft of my Web Development Profile

This is the preliminary deployment of my first developer profile. My objective is to build a profile that displays relevant information to a potential employer. This page while accomplish that by presenting the following:

* An opening section about myself.
* Selectable tiles that directly open examples of my work into a new tab.
* Several methods to contact me directly.
* A navigation bar that directs the user to the appropriate section.

For the time being, much of this information is populated with placeholder text, images (from previous coursework or placeimg.com), and links. In further iterations of the page, the information will reflect more on how I want to present myself along with further displays of my other completed work.

## Navigation

The top of this profile includes a nav bar that links to three main sections of this page. When clicked, these links utilize a CSS scroll that smoothly transitions to each respective section. In desktop mode, the nav bar is displayed horizontally and aligned toward the left. In mobile mode the header and nav bar links are stacked on top of each other vertically and are centered.


## About Me

This section will display a quick blurb about myself that will attract future employers. It also includes a picture of myself aligned to the right. In mobile mode, the heading, blurb, and profile picture are stacked vertically. In addition the profile picture is resized to better occupy the available space.

## My Work

This is a catalog of my ongoing work. In the future, either my most recent or most impressive project will headline this section by occupying the largest tile available. Additional projects and a link to my github profile will be available in the tiles following the headliner. Mobile mode will stack all elements vertically and each tile becomes the same size.

## Contact Information

Here you will find all of the best ways to contact me. This includes my phone number, email, github profile, and linkedin profile. In mobile mode, these contact methods are stacked vertically and are centered.
